                <p class="p-1 text-justify">Web browsing history refers to the list of web pages a user has visited, as well as associated
                    metadata such as page
                    title and time of visit. It is usually stored locally by web browsers[1][2] in order to provide the
                    user with a history
                    list to go back to previously visited pages. It can reflect the user's interests, needs, and
                    browsing habits.[3]

                    All major browsers have a private browsing mode in which browsing history is not recorded. This is
                    to protect against
                    browsing history being collected by third parties for targeted advertising or other purposes.

                    Applications
                    Local history
                    Locally stored browsing history can facilitate rediscovering lost previously visited web pages of
                    which one only has a
                    vague memory in mind, or pages difficult to find due to being located within deep web. Browsers also
                    utilize it to
                    enable autocompletion in their address bar for quicker and more convenient navigation to frequently
                    visited pages.[4]

                    The retention span of browsing history varies per internet browser. Mozilla Firefox (desktop
                    version) records history
                    indefinitely by default inside a file named places.sqlite, but automatically erases the earliest
                    history upon exhausted
                    disk space,[1] while Google Chrome (desktop version) stores history for ten weeks by default,
                    automatically pruning
                    earlier entries. An indefinite history file named Archived History was once recorded, but has been
                    removed and
                    automatically deleted in version 37, released in September 2014.[5][6]

                    Browser extensions such as History Trends Unlimited for Google Chrome (desktop version) allow the
                    indefinite local
                    storage of browsing history, exporting into a portable file, and self-analysis of browsing habits
                    and statistics</p>

                <h2 class="text-center">2. Our Present</h2>
                <p class="p-1 text-justify">In linguistics and rhetoric, the historical present or historic present, also called dramatic present
                    or narrative
                    present, is the employment of the present tense when narrating past events. It is widely used in
                    writing about history
                    in Latin (where it is sometimes referred to by its Latin name, praesens historicum) and some modern
                    European languages.
                    In English, it is used above all in historical chronicles (listing a series of events). It is also
                    used in fiction, for
                    "hot news" (as in headlines), and in everyday conversation.[1] In conversation, it is particularly
                    common with quotative
                    verbs such as say and go,[2] and especially the newer quotative like.[3][4] It is typically thought
                    to heighten the
                    dramatic force of the narrative by describing events as if they were still unfolding, and/or by
                    foregrounding some
                    events relative to others.[5][6]

                    Examples
                    In an excerpt from Charles Dickens's David Copperfield, the shift from the past tense to the
                    historical present gives a
                    sense of immediacy, as of a recurring vision:

                    If the funeral had been yesterday, I could not recollect it better. The very air of the best
                    parlour, when I went in at
                    the door, the bright condition of the fire, the shining of the wine in the decanters, the patterns
                    of the glasses and
                    plates, the faint sweet smell of cake, the odour of Miss Murdstone's dress, and our black clothes.
                    Mr. Chillip is in the
                    room, and comes to speak to me.

                    "And how is Master David?" he says, kindly.

                    I cannot tell him very well. I give him my hand, which he holds in his.

                    — Charles Dickens, David Copperfield, Chapter IX
                    Novels that are written entirely in the historical present include notably John Updike's Rabbit,
                    Run, Hilary Mantel's
                    Wolf Hall and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale.</p>

        <h2>3. Our Future</h2>
        <p class="p-4 text-justify">The Future of Web Design
            Technology is always changing, and we can only make assumptions on the evolution of web design based on a
            number of
            clear certainties.

            Growth in high speed always online internet connections.
            The mobile audience will grow and inevitably exceed traditional desktop/laptop based users. More than that,
            we are going
            to see more and more devices without typical browsing and physical interfaces becoming internet enabled.
            It is already understood that the 20-30 age group is already expecting a degree of interaction with their
            favourite
            brands. This trend is only going to increase.
            Some experts such as Peter Spiegel have expected the website itself to die out, with content and APIs
            becoming more
            important in connecting and engaging with audiences and the growing fragmentation of internet enabled
            devices. Audiences
            have grown accustomed with the traditional form of the website and their interest and engagement rates have
            acclimatised
            accordingly if brutally, with a mere 5 seconds to make an impression. As a result, content that presents a
            kind of
            narrative through a more creative delivery is more effective. But then, how many of these narratives can an
            audience.</p>
