    <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Who we are</h3>
    <p class="p-4 text-justify">
        The about us page is commonly used by all types of businesses to give customers more insight into who is involved with a
        given business and exactly what it does. The history of a business is often provided, and the histories of the people in
        charge are usually expressed through short articles, usually accompanied by photographs.
        
        Depending on the specific company, some information about goals, attitude or other aspects of culture that aren't
        strictly tied to business practices are included as well. The about us page is often a reflection of the purpose and
        personality of the business and its owners or top employees. Finally, the page can also incorporate contact or
        locational information. One way to view the about us concept is as a text self-portrait or short autobiography created
        by a business.

    <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Mission</h3>
    <p class="p-4 text-justify">
        A mission statement is an action-oriented statement declaring the purpose an organization serves to its audience. It
        often includes a general description of the organization, its function, and its objectives.
        
        As a company grows, its objectives and goals may be reached, and in turn, they'll change. Therefore, mission statements
        should be revised as needed to reflect the business's new culture as previous goals are met.
        The best brands combine physical, emotional, and logical elements into one exceptional customer (and employee)
        experience that you value as much as they do. A good mission statement will not only explain your brand’s purpose, but
        will also foster a connection with customers.
        
        When your brand creates a genuine connection with customers and employees, they'll stay loyal to your company, thereby
        increasing your overall profitability.
        
        Mission statements also help you stand out in the marketplace, differentiating your brand from the competition.

    <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Vission</h3>
    <p class="p-4 text-justify">
        A vision statement is aspirational and expresses your brand’s plan or “vision” for the future and potential impact on
        the world. They often serve as a guide for a brand’s future goals and explain why customers and employees should stick
        around for the long-haul.
        Your company vision is meant to be inspirational while also aligning with the company’s mission. A vision statement
        should have the following characteristics:
        
        Aspirational and Ambitious: Have a lofty outlook for what you want your business to accomplish? Here’s the place to put
        it. Your vision statement should be aspirational and showcase how your business will grow in the future.
        Practical and Achievable: While your statement should be ambitious, it shouldn’t be impossible. Set a goal that is both
        challenging and practical.
        General: Your vision should be broad enough to encompass all of your brand’s overall goals. Think of it in terms of an
        umbrella for your mission statement and company objectives to nest under.
